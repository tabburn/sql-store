## Summary
The purpose of this analysis is to develop SQL skills by answering questions like:
* Write a query that joins the order_items table with the products table such that each order displays the product_id, the name of the product, quantity, and unit price.
* Write a query that returns the order_date, order_id, first_name, shipper (even if none exists), and status.

These questions are answered through managing and manipulating relational databases.
